2. My shopping cart will have the items listed going down a list with the items name price and will have a blue theme. It will be integrated to the products pages. For example, if a user chooses an item, it will instantly go to the cart, and they will be able to remove from the cart if needed.
  <br>
3. For managing my shopping cart I will be using sessions so the cookie is stored in the session and when the user returns the item stay in the cart until the user removes it and it will be fully with the session in permanent to the users id. 
  <br>
4. To avoid access to the application when user is not logged in yet or registered, I will have a block page and put in errors to show this is not valid and user must log to access the application. 
  <br>
5. To add personalization I will put Welcome and the users name, and I will have a continue exploring. or make it so their cookies are stores so they can see previous things they have viewed or maybe shopped for. They will have an account information to.
  <br>
6. I am doing everything myself throughout this whole week.
  <br>
7. For assignment 3 I am hoping everything works right and the validations are working properly for when a user logs in and uses the application and I will make sure my products work.
