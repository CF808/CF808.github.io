  <p><em>Chareen: Basics Technical Essay</em></p>

<p>For my first WOD browser history 1. As suggested, I tried on my own at first, I spent 15 minutes just pasting and getting all the headings, paragraphs down on vs code. I also spent a good amount of time trying to make WODS its own directory. Then I went back to the instructions watched the getting started video and figured out where I went wrong. Finally, was able to make the WOD directory and add the file in. Thus, after this I now understand the directoryâ€™s, files and so on. I attempted to try the WOD exercise again. This time I could not get the coding right for adding links and could not do the table of contents. Thus, I went to watch the screencast. Which helped me figure the code for everything. I started to take some notes. Once again, I attempted to do the WOD exercise for the 3rd and 4th try I got everything down. I wanted to get the RX time which I got the 5th try. I was very happy to know I finally got everything right. There is a strategy to get everything down quicker. For my browser history 2 I was hesitant to get the WOD completed then, I tried it my 2nd time by watching the screencast I learned its much easier to get the CSS into the website. For my browser history 3 i felt it was very simple since I got most of the steps down from the previous WODs.</p>
